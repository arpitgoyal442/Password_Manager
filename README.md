<h2>This is a Password Manager App For Android Devcices. Here all the Passwords will be  stored in local storage and are <b>Encrypted.</b></h2>
<h3> We have used <b>AES Enrcyption</b>.</h3>
<h2>AES Encryption</h2>
<h3>AES is an iterative rather than Feistel cipher. It is based on ‘substitution–permutation network’. It comprises of a series of linked operations, some of which involve replacing inputs by specific outputs (substitutions) and others involve shuffling bits around (permutations).</h3>
<h3>The features of AES are as follows −

Symmetric key symmetric block cipher
128-bit data, 128/192/256-bit keys
Stronger and faster than Triple-DES
Provide full specification and design details
Software implementable in C and Java</h3>

<h3>Till date, no practical cryptanalytic attacks against AES has been discovered. Additionally, AES has built-in flexibility of key length, which allows a degree of ‘future-proofing’ against progress in the ability to perform exhaustive key searches.</h3>

<h2>For Database We have Used SQlite Database</h2>
<h3>Sqlite is quite fast and as file is saved on user's phone so its quite secure.</h3>
